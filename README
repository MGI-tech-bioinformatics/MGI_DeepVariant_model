MGI-model.split.tar:
There are three models in this tar file. We used MGI sequencer data to train these models. These models is:
WGS-PCR-model: is used for calling WGS PCR data;
WGS-PCR-free-model: is used for calling WGS PCR-free data;
WES-model: is used for calling WES data.
We split the model tar file to 12 small files because of GitHub's maximun file size.
You can use the following command to decompress:
	cd ./MGI-model.split.tar
	cat MGI-model.tar.gz.* | tar -zxv
